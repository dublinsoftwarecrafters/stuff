The manifesto for Software Craftsmanship 

This is an open community for those Developers who care about what they do, regardless how experienced they are. We want to build a community around passionate developers, interested in improving their technical skills, in discussing and sharing their knowledge with their peers.

This is all about "learning by doing": Coding Dojos, Architectural Katas, Mob sessions, moderated discussions, reading club, ...

We value:

• Practical, concrete discussions on code over generic talks. 
• Solutions applicable in any language over vendor-specific tool marketing. 
• Exchange of ideas in an open environment over passive listening. 
• Learning by practising with peers over hearing and forgetting.
